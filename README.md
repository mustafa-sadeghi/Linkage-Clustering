# Linkage Clustering

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive guide on **Linkage Clustering**, a technique used in hierarchical clustering within unsupervised machine learning. It combines theoretical insights with practical Python implementations for easy learning.

## Features

- Clustering fundamentals and key concepts
- Detailed exploration of distance measures (Euclidean, Manhattan, etc.)
- Step-by-step explanation of linkage methods (single, complete, average)
- Numerical exercises with solutions
- Practical Python examples and code snippets

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `scipy`

Install dependencies using:

```bash
